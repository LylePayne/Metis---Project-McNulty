# Metis---Project-McNulty


Each group worked as the internal data science team at a fictional company in the insurance agency (details were theirs to determine). In class we covered supervised learning algorithms and relational databases. Each student worked on their own classification model that fit within the overall goals of the company and the team. We also did a deep dive on visualization package d3 and learned enough about web to create our own APIs on the python flask microframework to serve data from our databases to our visualizations.
